# LixSTL

## Introduction

An easy implementation of C++ STL in C++17.

The components to be implemented: traits, allocator, container, algorithm.

This project is just started and I'm still working on it.

I will write documents to introduce all components (in Chinese).

If you're interested on this project, you can star it and come back in serveral weeks :)
